## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus:** Dark mode toggle

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- NPM
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## What I learned

In this project, I utilized my skills in JavaScript and DOM manipulation to build a responsive and intuitive credit card form. I used Webpack to bundle my assets and optimized the build process using plugins like MiniCssExtractPlugin and HtmlWebpackPlugin.

To improve the user experience, I implemented custom error messages and a "complete" screen that appears after the form is successfully submitted. I created real-time validation and feedback for the user by applying my knowledge of JavaScript. I also included a dark mode toggle and utilized localStorage to store the user's preferred theme.

Overall, this project provided me with valuable experience in building interactive web applications and utilizing various front-end technologies to improve the user experience.
